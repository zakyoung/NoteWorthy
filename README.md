# NoteWorthy

Noteworthy is an iPad-only application designed to enhance the default notes app provided by Apple. The current notes app from Apple is considered can be more complex than necessary, leading to a need for simpler, more intuitive solutions. Noteworthy aims to offer an intuitive experience at no charge.

The application will feature a range of tools that improve user experience. Users will be able to quickly create new notes with a simple tap, organize notes into subjects, and sort notes by creation date, last modified date, name, and other criteria. Additional features will include automatically adding new pages as needed, customizable note backgrounds, color selection for pens, pencils, and highlighters, the inclusion of typed text, image insertion, and a lasso tool for moving text around. These enhancements aim to provide a richer, more flexible note-taking experience.

The overarching goal of Noteworthy is to offer a superior note-taking experience, enriching functionality without added cost. More unique features will be outlined in the Features section.
